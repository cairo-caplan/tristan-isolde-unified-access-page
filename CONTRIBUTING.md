# Contributing
New Contributors and new Members are always welcome!
Although membership is not required, most Contributors are [members](https://openhwfoundation.org/membership/become-a-member/)
of the OpenHW Foundation and participate in one or more of our [Projects](https://openhwfoundation.org/projects/).


## Contributor Agreement
Contributors **must** be covered by the terms of the [Eclipse Contributor Agreement](https://www.eclipse.org/legal/ECA.php)
(for individuals) **or** the [Eclipse Member Committer and Contributor Agreement](https://www.eclipse.org/legal/committer_process/EclipseMemberCommitterAgreement.pdf)
(for employees of Member companies). The ECA/MCCA provides a legal
framework for a Contributor's technical contributions to the OpenHW Foundation,
including provisions for grant of copyright license and a Developer
Certificate of Origin on contributions merged into OpenHW Foundation repositories.
